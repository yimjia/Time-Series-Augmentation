# Time-Series-Augmentation
We developed a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to efficiently augment the time series of extratropical cyclone severity measures (wind speed and flood elevation). 
As a generative model, the developed CVAE learns the probability distribution of latent features (here, low-dimensional underlying characteristics of the time series) as a multivariate normal distribution. 
The augmented severity measure time series are then obtained in two steps: 1) randomly sampling data from the learned multivariate normal distribution, and 2) using the randomly sampled data as the input to the decoder of the trained CVAE to generate time series of severity measures.

The develoepd CVAE is not limited to augmenting the time series of extratropical cycloneâ€™s wind speeds and flood elevations, it can also be applied to augment any time series data (one-dimensional or multidimensional), which would be benefit from augmentation.

Note that the files with size larger than 25 MB (Aug_TimeSeries.mat in Example folder and Aug.dat in Example/Data_Lat4_Epoch50000_Aug folder Aug.dat) cannot be directly downloaded using **Download ZIP**. The authors recommend download these files manually by clicking on these files, select "Download raw file" from the top right menu bar, and move the downloaded files to the corresponding folders.

Note that the codes were run on Python 3.10.14 (TensorFlow 2.13.1 required) and Matlab R2023b. The authors recommend running the Python codes on Jupyter Notebook. Running the codes on different versions of Python, TensorFlow, or Matlab may result in compatibility issues. However, most compatibility issues can be resolved by following the suggestions in the error messages.
